There, we created a sensor to test the water level. We used 3 LED lights to understand the reading. When the threshold value is 300, then the red light will be on until it reaches the medium value of the threshold, which is 500. When the threshold hits 500, the yellow light will be on until 700. Finally threshold value 700 means it will be the maximum water level, and the green light will be on.
